# FOSS-Deck

I will get inspiration from these projects:
### 1. [Freedeck](https://freedeck.app/)
- Free and open-source alternative to Elgato Stream Deck.
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Built using Electron and Node.js.
- Supports customizable buttons and plugin extensions (e.g., OBS).

### 2. [ODeck](https://github.com/willianrod/ODeck)
- Electron + React-based customizable deck with mobile support.
- Actions include launching apps, media control, and hotkeys.
- Available for Android and iOS as well.

### 3. [Open-Deck](https://github.com/JJetmar/open-deck)
- Local web-based Stream Deck system using Node.js and WebSockets.
- JSON config file for layout and function customization.

### 4. [StreamPi](https://github.com/anasancho/streampi_client)
- Designed for Raspberry Pi with JavaFX.
- Touchscreen-focused and compatible with OBS.
- Platform-agnostic (Linux, Windows, macOS).

### 5. [StreamKit](https://github.com/vinebarbosa/stream-kit)
- Lightweight, Electron/React-based tool.
- Still in development.
- Includes UI/UX mockups (Figma files available).

## üß© Technologies I Might Use

- **Electron** / **Tauri**: Desktop GUI wrapper.
- **React** or **Vue.js**: For modern frontend UI.
- **Node.js**: Backend logic and integration scripts.
- **Python + OpenCV**: For any camera or vision-based features.
- **Arduino / ESP32**: For physical button integration.
- **MQTT / WebSockets**: Communication between hardware and software.
- **OBS WebSocket API**: To control streaming software like OBS Studio.
